### FIRST Robotics Team Experience
*2016 - 2019*
# Freshman Year: Joining the Team
I joined our [FIRST robotics team](https://www.pigmice.com/) as a freshman, eager to immerse myself in the world of engineering and robotics. This initial year provided a foundation in teamwork, basic mechanical concepts, and the excitement of competitive robotics.

# Sophomore Year: Build Lead
In my sophomore year, I was appointed as the Build Lead. Under the mentorship of the Manufacturing Captain, I gained invaluable experience in leadership and hands-on engineering. Our department was responsible for transforming designs from the Design Department into functional components for our robot. We began prototyping with wood and cardboard, allowing for quick iterations and testing. Once designs were finalized, we manufactured the parts using aluminum, ensuring durability and precision.

# Junior Year: Co-Leading as Manufacturing Captain
My junior year marked a significant step forward as I was elected to co-lead as the Manufacturing Captain. This role intensified my responsibilities and honed my skills in organization, communication, and managing a team under stressful environments. Our hard work and improved processes paid off, as we advanced to the District Championships for the first time in many years. This achievement was a testament to our improved design, iteration, and testing methods.

# Senior Year: Team Captain
In my senior year, I was honored to be elected as the Team Captain, co-leading the entire team. My focus on leadership, organization, and fostering effective communication among team members culminated in an exceptional season. We advanced to the World-level competition in Houston, TX, where we became finalists in the playoffs of our division. Our teamâ€™s journey ended only after a closely contested match with the eventual world champions.

Throughout my journey with the FIRST robotics team, I developed a strong foundation in engineering principles, leadership, and teamwork. These experiences have significantly shaped my approach to problem-solving and project management, skills that I continue to apply in my ongoing engineering endeavors.

### [RingGame](https://github.com/DexterCarpenter/RingGame)
*2020*

An Arduino-based arcade style game. Press the button when the lights line up to proceed to a faster level. 

This was a one-day project. Using a Adafruit Neopixel ring (24), an Arduinio Uno, and a button I created a game where the objective is to press the button when the "runner" and the "selector" are aligned. If you are successful, you get a green flash and the runner gets faster. This proceeds until you miss, in which an animation plays and restarts the runner's speed.

My goal was to make this as simple as possible, using just the NeoPixel and a button as the UI.
