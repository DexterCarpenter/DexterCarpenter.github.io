<!-- Rocket Design Details -->

*Hi! You're probably here because you wanted to learn more about the specific design of the rocket. Here I'll get into more details about the sections that I worked on specifically. If you want even more detail, see the [Project Technical Report](/portfolio/#esra-project-technical-report).*

## General Rocket Overview

Make sure to talk about being single-sep dual-deploy....

The team was greatly constrained by the dimensions of our body tube. It was donated to us by [ICE](https://www.innovativecomposite.com/), a composites engineering company that donates composite tubes to all of OSU's rocketry teams each year. If you're at all confused as to what I mean by 'composite' you can read about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material). The tube we obtained had a specific, non-standard diameter. This meant that nearly all the major components on the rocket had to be custom-designed and manufactured. This is a significant challenge even for veteran teams. We did not have the option of buying COTS couplers or a nosecone, and purchasing a standard tube was well outside our budget. The diameter of the rocket was ~6" which is adequate for a 30k ft rocket, and very over-sized for a 10k. This also meant that our rocket had to be much longer (14ft) in order to maintain a good stability factor.
