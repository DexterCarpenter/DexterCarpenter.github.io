title: About Me
---

Hello! I am a recent graduate from Oregon State University with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. My passion for engineering began in high school, where I was an active member and eventually the team captain of our [robotics team](https://www.pigmice.com/). This early exposure to hands-on problem-solving and teamwork laid the foundation for my academic and professional journey. At Oregon State, I further honed my skills and knowledge, culminating in leading a rocketry team for my Capstone project. I invite you to explore my [Portfolio](/portfolio), where you can see the diverse projects I've worked on and learn more about my experience and expertise. Thank you for visiting!
